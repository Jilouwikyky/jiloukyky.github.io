As you can already notice at the top of the page, my name is Wilky Gandy JEAN-LOUIS.

I am a full-stack web developer who experimented with different technologies based on Java and Javascript 
(Spring, Hibernate, AngularJS/Angular, React). 

Every day I have the opportunity to concretize good ideas either at work or on my projects (one of them is [Lek√≤l](https:lekol.ht){:target="_blank"}, where I am Co-founder and CTO).
If you have one and want to book me, just let me know at [hey@wiljeanlouis.com](mailto:hey@wiljeanlouis.com).

When I am not programming, I sharpen my mind on new subjects like personal development, DeFi, and Cryptocurrency. I like watching good movies/series too, like Silicon Valley, Halt In Catch Fire, StartUp, Breaking Bad, etc.
