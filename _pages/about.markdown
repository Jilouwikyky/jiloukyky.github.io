As you can already notice at the of the page, my name is Wilky Gandy JEAN-LOUIS.

I am a fullstack web developer experimented with a lot of technologies based on Java and Javascript 
(Spring, Hibernate, AngularJS/Angular, React). 

Everyday I have the opportunity to concretize good ideas either at work or on my personal projects 
(one of them is [Lek√≤l](https:lekol.ht){:target="_blank"}, where I am Co-founder and CTO).
If you have one and want to book me, just let me know at [hey@wiljeanlouis.com](mailto:hey@wiljeanlouis.com).

When I am not programming, I like to sharpen my mind on subjects like Personal developement, DeFi and Cryptocurrency. I like to watch good movies/series too like Silicon Valley, Halt in catch fire, Startup,  Breaking Bad.
